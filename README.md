# HTML Email Editor

The HTML Email Editor has be brought to life as a free-of-charge alternative to popular newsletter creator tools.
It was aimed to provide a quick-and-dirty way to create responsive email layouts in HTML that, at least as of now, can be rendered and displayed by all major email providers (outlook, gmail, ...).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.


## Usage

Once the project is up and running (see following sections), the editing process consists of three main stages:
1. Create the HTML layout based on a selection of implemented components.
2. If necessary, adjust the created HTML code based on needs not covered in drag-and-drop mode. Such needs could include highlighting or linking to external web pages.
3. Insert the generated HTML code in your email provider of choice. An example on how to do so with gmail can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmWvTzvUMVY)


## Installation

Before getting started, make sure you have Node and npm installed. Instructions on how to do so can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Run `npm install` to install any missing packages and dependencies.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


If you wish to use the HTML Email Editor as a desktop app, feel free to check out [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs) for details on packaging and portability.
